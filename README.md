# Notes on Deep Learning 

In this repo I am collecting personal notes on topics in deep learning. Particularly interested in more foundational questions like
* Why can over-parameterizied networks generalize?
* Why are gradient descent methods able to reliably find useful minimas in a high dimensional non-convex space?
* Why do vastly different network initializations lead to similair solutions after training?
* Do we expect a proper understanding of deep learning to translate to insights into the learning process and intelligent behaviour of biological systems?

While these notes are usually written in prose they should be understood as a "diary" of notes and thoughts as I explore a specific topic.
