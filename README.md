# Notes on Deep Learning theory

Some loose notes around the question of why deep learning works at all

## Questions
* Why can overparameterized models generalize? 
* Why does SGD lead to solutions which seem to be global minima in a high-dimensional non-convex "landscape"?
* Is there a connection between Artifcial neurol networks and the brain? If yes, what is it?
